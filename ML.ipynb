    "# **Predicting Seattle Resident's Customer Requests**\n",
    "\n",
    "The City of Seattle has collected extensive data on resident service requests through its customer service portals over many years. These requests cover a wide range of issues, from pothole repairs to unauthorized encampments, providing a valuable opportunity to understand public service demand patterns over time.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, we focus on forecasting the number of service requests expected over the next three months (May, June, and July 2025). Our goal is to build predictive models that can accurately estimate future service volumes for each Service Request Type, as well as extend to predictions at the Department level and for specific ZIP Code and Service Request Type combinations.\n",
    "\n",
    "To achieve this, we preprocess the data by aggregating historical service requests at a monthly level. We engineer time series features such as Lag (previous month's request counts) and Rolling Statistics (rolling mean and standard deviation) to give our models \"memory\" of past trends and fluctuations. These features help capture seasonality, stability, and short-term changes in service request volumes.\n",
    "\n",
    "We evaluate four models: Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost. Each model is globally tuned before applying 5-fold time-based cross-validation to fairly compare their performance across service types. Final model selection for each service is based on minimizing the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) to ensure robust forecasting even across diverse and unpredictable service categories.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our final predictions aim to equip city agencies with actionable insights, allowing them to allocate resources more effectively, anticipate resident needs, and plan operational efforts during the upcoming months."

    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "Through time series modeling and predictive analysis of Seattle’s historical service request data, we successfully forecasted the expected number of service requests for each Service Request Type over the next three months. By engineering critical features such as lag values and rolling statistics, and by tuning and evaluating multiple machine learning models — including Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost — we identified the best-performing model for each service category.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our results showed strong predictive performance on high-volume and stable service types, while naturally encountering greater variability in smaller, more irregular service types. This outcome reflects common patterns in real-world forecasting, where rare or seasonal services present higher prediction challenges.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, the models and forecasts developed in this project provide a data-driven foundation for Seattle’s departments to anticipate resident needs, allocate resources more efficiently, and plan operational strategies for the coming months. Future work could extend this approach by incorporating external factors, such as weather or event calendars, to further refine forecasts for highly seasonal or irregular service types."
