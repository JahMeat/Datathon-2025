# Seattle Service Request Forecasting

## Team Name
**Two Ts and a Dream**

## Project Overview
In this project, we analyze historical service request data from the City of Seattle to forecast the volume of requests for the next three months (May, June, and July 2025). Using time series analysis, feature engineering (including lag and rolling statistics), and machine learning models, we generate actionable predictions for each Service Request Type. 

Additionally, we visualize key patterns and trends using Tableau to support operational planning and resource allocation.

## Final Models
We evaluated multiple models — Linear Regression, Random Forest, LightGBM, and XGBoost — and selected the best-performing model for each service category based on Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).

## Tableau Dashboards
We created two interactive Tableau dashboards to visualize insights and predictions:

- **Government Service Data Analysis:**
